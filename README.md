# toolsforvideo-text
The tools is for video-text so that could find points  


1. I use google colab to fullfill it
   
2. So far i could only use short video to show youtube-text, if you want to do it longer, maybe it could be suceesful, but you may spend lots of time excuting the code.
   
3. i use hugging face model to show the video-text. you can change your favorite one
 
4. i use gemini to help me fulfill RAG

5. refer to the github: https://github.com/pecu/Tools






### it is for future that once i do not want to hear the voice, only wants to find text. (a little tool)
